- ACMG原始定义：Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.
Caveat: Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.
- **Supporting** ✅：\<6 total alleles in gnomAD or \<0.00004 (0.004%) in gnomAD subpopulations.


#### PM4
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Moderate
- ACMG原始定义：Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.
- **Moderate** ✅：Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.


#### PM5
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Moderate
- ACMG原始定义：Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.
Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys.
Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.
- **Strong** ✅：≥2 different missense changes at same codon have been determined to be likely pathogenic or pathogenic based on HHT VCEP rules.
- **Moderate** ✅：A different missense change at same codon has been determined to be likely pathogenic or pathogenic based on HHT VCEP rules.


#### PP1
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.
Note: May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.
- **Strong** ✅：5+ meioses (1/32 likelihood)
- **Moderate** ✅：4 meioses (1/16 likelihood)
- **Supporting** ✅：3 meioses (1/8 likelihood)


#### PP3
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Supporting
