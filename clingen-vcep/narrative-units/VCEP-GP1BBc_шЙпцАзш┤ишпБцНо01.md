## 规范 1：GN082 — Platelet Disorders Variant Curation Expert Panel

### 良性质证据规则（BS/BP/BA）

#### BA1
- 默认强度：Benign Stand Alone
- ACMG原始定义：Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.
- **Stand Alone** ✅：gnomAD MAF greater than or equal to 0.001 (or 0.1%) in gnomAD.


#### BS1
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.
- **Strong** ✅：gnomAD MAF greater than or equal to 0.0005 but less than 0.001.


#### BS2
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.
- **Strong** ✅：Use this rule with 1 or more homozygotes who are unaffected (proven with aggregometry OR flow cytometry AND normal platelet count AND normal platelet size).


#### BS3
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.
- **Strong** ✅：Must demonstrate normal aggregometry in a transgenic mouse model


#### BS4
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.
Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.
- **Strong** ✅：Variant not tracking in an affected family member.


#### BP2
- 默认强度：Benign Supporting
