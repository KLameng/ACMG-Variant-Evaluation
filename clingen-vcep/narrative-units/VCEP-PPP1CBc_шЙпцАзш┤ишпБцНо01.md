## 规范 1：GN128 — RASopathy Variant Curation Expert Panel

### 良性质证据规则（BS/BP/BA）

#### BA1
- 默认强度：Benign Stand Alone
- ACMG原始定义：Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.
- **Stand Alone** ✅：GnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.05%.


#### BS1
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.
- **Strong** ✅：GnomAD filtering allele frequency ≥0.025%.


#### BS2
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.
- **Strong** ✅：\-4 Points.


#### BS4
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.
Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.
- **Strong** ✅：Requires only one informative meiosis.


#### BP1
- 默认强度：Benign Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：Missense variant in a gene for which primarily truncating variants are known to cause disease.
