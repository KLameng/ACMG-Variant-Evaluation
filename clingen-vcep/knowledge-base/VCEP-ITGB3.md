## 规范 1：GN011 — Platelet Disorders Variant Curation Expert Panel

### 覆盖疾病
- **MONDO:0100326**（遗传方式：未指定）

### 基因特异性证据规则

#### PVS1
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Very Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Null variant (nonsense, frameshift, canonical +/−1 or 2 splice sites, initiation codon, single or multi-exon deletion) in a gene where loss of function (LOF) is a known mechanism of disease.
Caveats:
 * Beware of genes where LOF is not a known disease mechanism (e.g. GFAP, MYH7).
 * Use caution interpreting LOF variants at the extreme 3’ end of a gene.
 * Use caution with splice variants that are predicted to lead to exon skipping but leave the remainder of the protein intact.
 * Use caution in the presence of multiple transcripts.
- **Very Strong** ✅：Use decision tree as per SVI WG with specified “regions critical to protein function”.

#### PS1
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Same amino acid change as a previously established pathogenic variant regardless of nucleotide change.
Example: Val->Leu caused by either G>C or G>T in the same codon.
Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.
- **Strong** ✅：Use with no specification.

#### PS2
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Strong
- ACMG原始定义：De novo (both maternity and paternity confirmed) in a patient with the disease and no family history.
Note: Confirmation of paternity only is insufficient. Egg donation, surrogate motherhood, errors in embryo transfer, etc. can contribute to non-maternity.
- **Strong** ✅：Use proposed SVI point recommendations.
* Only applicable when proband has a known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant with the de novo variant
- **Moderate** ✅：Use proposed SVI point recommendations.
 * Only applicable when proband has a known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant with the de novo variant

#### PS3
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies supportive of a damaging effect on the gene or gene product.
Note: Functional studies that have been validated and shown to be reproducible and robust in a clinical diagnostic laboratory setting are considered the most well-established.
- **Strong** ✅：* In a transgenic animal model, must demonstrate minimal to no function.
  OR
* In a model organism or heterologous cell line, EITHER (A) when expression is normal or reduced, disruption of protein function must be demonstrated OR (B) Absent surface protein expression (<5%).
- **Moderate** ✅：In a model organism or heterologous cell line, significantly reduced surface protein expression (5
 * 25%).

#### PS4
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Strong
- ACMG原始定义：The prevalence of the variant in affected individuals is significantly increased compared to the prevalence in controls.
Note 1: Relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR), as obtained from case-control studies, is >5.0 and the confidence interval around the estimate of RR or OR does not include 1.0. See manuscript for detailed guidance.
Note 2: In instances of very rare variants where case-control studies may not reach statistical significance, the prior observation of the variant in multiple unrelated patients with the same phenotype, and its absence in controls, may be used as moderate level of evidence.
- **Strong** ✅：Rule does not apply due to rarity of disorder and lack of appropriate studies.

#### PM1
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Moderate
- ACMG原始定义：Located in a mutational hot spot and/or critical and well-established functional domain (e.g. active site of an enzyme) without benign variation.
- **Moderate** ✅：Rule does not apply due to genes being highly polymorphic.

#### PM2
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Moderate
- ACMG原始定义：Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.
Caveat: Population data for indels may be poorly called by next generation sequencing.
- **Moderate** ✅：Absent from controls (or at extremely low frequency if recessive) in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes Project, or Exome Aggregation Consortium
- **Supporting** ✅：Prevalence <1/10,000 (<0.0001) alleles in gnomAD.

#### PM3
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Moderate
- ACMG原始定义：For recessive disorders, detected in trans with a pathogenic variant
Note: This requires testing of parents (or offspring) to determine phase.
- **Very Strong** ✅：Use proposed SVI point recommendations. Both variants must be classified using ITGA2B/ITGB3 Rule Specifications.
- **Strong** ✅：Use proposed SVI point recommendations. Both variants must be classified using ITGA2B/ITGB3 Rule Specifications.
- **Moderate** ✅：Use proposed SVI point recommendations. Both variants must be classified using ITGA2B/ITGB3 Rule Specifications.
- **Supporting** ✅：Use proposed SVI point recommendations. Both variants must be classified using ITGA2B/ITGB3 Rule Specifications.

#### PM4
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Moderate
- ACMG原始定义：Protein length changes due to in-frame deletions/insertions in a non-repeat region or stop-loss variants.
- **Moderate** ✅：Use with no specification.

#### PM5
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Moderate
- ACMG原始定义：Novel missense change at an amino acid residue where a different missense change determined to be pathogenic has been seen before.
Example: Arg156His is pathogenic; now you observe Arg156Cys.
Caveat: Beware of changes that impact splicing rather than at the amino acid/protein level.
- **Moderate** ✅：Use with no specification.
- **Supporting** ✅：Use at adjusted strength.

#### PM6
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Moderate
- ACMG原始定义：Assumed de novo, but without confirmation of paternity and maternity.
- **Very Strong** ✅：Use proposed SVI point recommendations.
*  Only applicable when proband has a known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant with the de novo variant
- **Strong** ✅：Use proposed SVI point recommendations.
 * Only applicable when proband has a known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant with the de novo variant
- **Moderate** ✅：Use proposed SVI point recommendations.
 * Only applicable when proband has a known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant with the de novo variant
- **Supporting** ✅：Use proposed SVI point recommendations.
 * Only applicable when proband has a known pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant with the de novo variant

#### PP1
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：Co-segregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene definitively known to cause the disease.
Note: May be used as stronger evidence with increasing segregation data.
- **Strong** ✅：Segregations in proband plus >2 affected relatives.
 * Affected relatives must have both variants identified in proband.
- **Moderate** ✅：Segregation in proband plus 2 affected relatives.
 * Affected relatives must have both variants identified in proband.
- **Supporting** ✅：Segregation in proband plus 1 affected relative.
 * Affected relatives must have both variants identified in proband.

#### PP2
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：Missense variant in a gene that has a low rate of benign missense variation and where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease.
- **Supporting** ✅：This rule does not apply because benign missense variants are not rare.

#### PP3
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect on the gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc.).
Caveat: As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm should not be counted as an independent criterion. PP3 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.
- **Supporting** ✅：REVEL score of ≥ 0.7
  OR
2 independent in silico missense predictors predict a damaging impact

#### PP4
- 默认强度：Pathogenic Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：Patient’s phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.
- **Strong** ✅：Proband with clinical diagnosis of GT based on the presence of mucocutaneous bleeding and appropriate lab abnormalities. Full sequencing of both genes is required at this strength
- **Moderate** ✅：Proband with clinical diagnosis of GT based on the presence of mucocutaneous bleeding and appropriate lab abnormalities.
- **Supporting** ✅：Patients phenotype or family history is highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology

#### BA1
- 默认强度：Benign Stand Alone
- ACMG原始定义：Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.

- ACMG原始定义：Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.
- **Strong** ✅：Frequency cutoff of 0.158% (>0.00158 at 99.99% CI w/subpopulation w/min of 5 alleles)

#### BS2
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.
- **Strong** ✅：1 homozygote who is unaffected proven with at least aggregometry.

#### BS3
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Well-established in vitro or in vivo functional studies show no damaging effect on protein function or splicing.
- **Strong** ✅：* Must demonstrate normal aggregometry in a transgenic mouse model.
 OR
* In a heterologous cell line, must demonstrate BOTH normal expression and normal protein function

#### BS4
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.
Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.
- **Strong** ✅：Variant not detected in an affected family member.

#### BP1
- 默认强度：Benign Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：Missense variant in a gene for which primarily truncating variants are known to cause disease.

#### BP2
- 默认强度：Benign Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：Observed in trans with a pathogenic variant for a fully penetrant dominant gene/disorder or observed in cis with a pathogenic variant in any inheritance pattern.
- **Supporting** ✅：Use as written for recessive variants (i.e. - variant must be observed in cis with a pathogenic variant)

#### BP3
- 默认强度：Benign Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：In frame-deletions/insertions in a repetitive region without a known function.
- **Supporting** ✅：Use with no specification

#### BP4
- 默认强度：Benign Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：Multiple lines of computational evidence suggest no impact on gene or gene product (conservation, evolutionary, splicing impact, etc)
Caveat: As many in silico algorithms use the same or very similar input for their predictions, each algorithm cannot be counted as an independent criterion. BP4 can be used only once in any evaluation of a variant.
- **Supporting** ✅：REVEL score of < 0.25

#### BP5
- 默认强度：Benign Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：Variant found in a case with an alternate molecular basis for disease.
- **Supporting** ✅：Do not use this rule as an individual can be a carrier of an unrelated pathogenic variant for a recessive disorder.

#### BP7
- 默认强度：Benign Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：A synonymous variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved.
- **Supporting** ✅：Use with no specification.
