## 规范 1：GN129 — Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease  Variant Curation Expert Panel

### 良性质证据规则（BS/BP/BA）

#### BA1
- 默认强度：Benign Stand Alone
- ACMG原始定义：Allele frequency is above 5% in Exome Sequencing Project, 1000 Genomes or Exome Aggregation Consortium.
- **Stand Alone** ✅：gnomAD popmax filtering allele frequency >0.01110.


#### BS1
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Allele frequency is greater than expected for disorder.
- **Strong** ✅：gnomAD popmax filtering allele frequency >0.00249<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> Consider bottleneck populations


#### BS2
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Observed in a healthy adult individual for a recessive (homozygous), dominant (heterozygous), or X-linked (hemizygous) disorder, with full penetrance expected at an early age.
- **Strong** ✅：BS2\_Strong: Observed in >=3 (3 or more) hemizygotes in gnomAD.
- **Supporting** ✅：BS2\_Supporting: Can be applied at Supporting level of evidence if observed at least 2 hemizygotes in gnomAD.


#### BS4
- 默认强度：Benign Strong
- ACMG原始定义：Lack of segregation in affected members of a family.
Caveat: The presence of phenocopies for common phenotypes (i.e. cancer, epilepsy) can mimic lack of segregation among affected individuals. Also, families may have more than one pathogenic variant contributing to an autosomal dominant disorder, further confounding an apparent lack of segregation.
- **Strong** ✅：Can be applied without additional specifications.


#### BP7
- 默认强度：Benign Supporting
- ACMG原始定义：A synonymous variant for which splicing prediction algorithms predict no impact to the splice consensus sequence nor the creation of a new splice site AND the nucleotide is not highly conserved.
